# üèóÔ∏è Construction Cost Prediction



This project delivers a robust solution for predicting the total construction cost of building projects. By leveraging machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost regressors, it analyzes key features such as building type, location, area, number of floors, foundation type, roof type, and labor rates to provide accurate cost estimations. The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for interactive predictions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Accurate Cost Prediction**: Utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost regression models with 96%+ accuracy for high-precision cost estimations.
-   **Realistic Data Processing**: Works with construction costs ranging from $14M to $500M using MinMaxScaler preprocessing.
-   **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Implements robust data preprocessing pipelines, including feature scaling and encoding, to prepare data for machine learning.
-   **Interactive Web Interface**: Features a Streamlit-based frontend, allowing users to input project parameters and receive real-time cost predictions.
-   **Modular and Extensible Codebase**: Designed with a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend with new features or models.
-   **Multiple ML Models**: Compares Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and XGBoost to select the best performer.
-   **Binary Feature Handling**: Effectively manages binary input features (e.g., "Yes/No" options for basement, parking).

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### ‚úÖ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laavanjan/construction-cost-prediction.git
cd construction-cost-prediction
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
conda create --name cost-env python=3.11
conda activate cost-env
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Generate Realistic Dataset
