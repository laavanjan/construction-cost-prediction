Here's a **sample `README.md`** for your Construction Cost Prediction project:

---

```markdown
# 🏗️ Construction Cost Prediction

This project predicts the **total cost of a construction project** using key features like building type, area, number of floors, quality grade, location, and more. It includes data preprocessing, model training with Random Forest, and a Streamlit-based web app for user-friendly predictions.

Here's a complete `README.md` for your **Construction Cost Prediction** project, designed to be clear, professional, and GitHub-friendly:

---

```markdown
# 🏗️ Construction Cost Prediction

This project predicts the total construction cost of a building project based on various features such as building type, location, area, floors, quality, material index, and labor rate. The model uses machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost for regression, and includes a simple and interactive Streamlit web app.
